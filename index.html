    <h2>Introduction to Hillary Vula</h2>
    <p>Hillary Vula is known for being a detail-oriented, well-organized team player with excellent people and
        problem-solving skills. I have been working as a Service Desk Engineer for one year.
    </p>
    <p>At my current job in the technology department, I</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Address and deliver requested services and assist with general information or customer complaints within
            defined timelines.</li>
        <li>Perform root cause analysis of reported service requests and incidents.</li>
        <li>Manage escalations from customers and ensure feedback is provided within defined timelines.</li>
